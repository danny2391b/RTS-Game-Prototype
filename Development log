-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [31/03/2025], 16:56 - 18:13
### What I Worked On
- Implemented RTS camera movement using arrow keys with Enhanced Input.

### Challenges
- Couldn’t find Scale option in Enhanced Input.

### Solution
- Used 'Negate (Float)' modifier to make A = -1 and B = 1 for both.

### Next Steps
- Implement zoom, and edge scrolling for the RTS camera.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [31/03/2025], 18:13 - 19:40
### What I Worked On
- Fixed the right edge scrolling issue for the RTS camera.

### Challenges
- The camera was not moving when the mouse reached the right edge of the screen.

### Solution
- The issue was with the logic checking the mouse position.

- Originally, the condition was checking if Mouse X ≥ Edge Margin, which was incorrect.

- The correct condition is Mouse X ≥ (Viewport Width - EdgeMargin) to properly trigger right edge scrolling.

### Next Steps
- Implement zoom for the RTS camera and making the mouse visible
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [31/03/2025], 21:27 - 21:32
### What I worked on
- Making the mouse visible

### Challenges
- I have no clue how to

### Solution
- Searched online for an answer
- All I had to do was Get the player controller and set the Mouse curser to true on Event BeginPlay

### Next Steps
- Implement Zoom for the RTS Camera
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [01/04/2025], 15:00 - 16:13
### What I worked on
- Implemeting a zoom feature

### Challenges
- I have no clue how to change the FOV of the current camera
- Mouse wheel axis didn't work how i expected in the enhanced Input system
- Mouse wheel zoom in went the wrong way round so if i zoomed in it would zoom out
- couldn't work out how to stop the zoom going to far in or too far out

### Solution
- found a "Set Field Of View" node
- Used Mouse Wheel Up and Mouse Wheel Down instead and negated mouse wheel down
- Should have negated Mouse wheel up
- used SpringArm Length instead of FOV in case i want to mess with the fov
- used a clamp to make sure it doesn't go too far in or out

### Next Steps
- bug fixes with the camera then onto the rest of the prototype
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [01/04/2025], 16:27 - 16:58
### What I worked on
- Bug Fixes

### Bugs
- edge scrolling messes up when you change resolution or make it fullscreen 
- The Zoom doesn't zoom incrementally it zooms smoothly

### Solution
- I set the viewport width and height variables in the Event BeginPlay but I should have put it in Event Tick
- I just increased the multiply by action value so it's divisible by 1000 and i put 250 so there are 4 increments

### Next Steps
- the rest of the prototype
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [1/04/2025], 18:04 - 18:33
### What I Worked On
- Created a unit blueprint (BP_Unit).

- Set up collision for units.

### Challenges
- Had to adjust collision settings to ensure the unit could be clicked properly.

### Solution
- Set the Capsule Collision in BP_Unit to respond to visibility and clicks.

### Next Steps
- Implement unit movement using right-click.
- Implement unit selection.
- Add a selection highlight effect when a unit is selected.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [1/04/2025], 18:33 - 18:50
### What I Worked On
- Added Unit Selection

### Next Steps
- Implement unit movement using right-click.
- Add a selection highlight effect when a unit is selected.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [1/04/2025], 18:50 - 19:00
### What I Worked On
- making the variable type for selecting an array to make sure i can select multiple units in the future.

### Challenges
- couldn't remember how to

### Solution
- found the option next to it to change it to an array

### Next Steps
- Implement unit movement using right-click.
- Add a selection highlight effect when a unit is selected.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [4/04/2025], 19:32 - 21:37
### What I Worked On
- making a building system

### Challenges
- having to remember how to use instantiate

### Solutions 
- google whenever I got stuck

### Next Steps
- making buildings work
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [4/04/2025], 8:51 - 9:08
### What I Worked On
- Made buildings selectable with single click and Shift+click (similar to units)
- Created BuildingSelections system with highlighting support

### Challenges
- Null reference errors when trying to access highlight objects
- Some buildings didn't have child objects or expected components, causing crashes

### Solutions
- Added null checks and fallback logic to safely highlight buildings
- Ensured selection logic mirrors unit selection behavior for consistency

### Next Steps
- Make buildings interactable (e.g., open UI when selected)
- Add right-click command functionality (e.g., send units to buildings)
- Clean up selection visuals (standardize highlight object naming)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [4/04/2025], 9:26 - 9:49
### What I Worked On
- Implemented building selection functionality so clicking a building brings up its UI panel.

### Challenges
- Clicking a building did not trigger the UI to show, even though the logic was in place inside BuildingSelections.

### Solutions
- Realized the click logic was always calling UnitSelections, even for buildings.

- Added a tag check ("Unit" and "Building") in UnitClick.cs to route the click to the correct selection manager.

- Once the building was routed to BuildingSelections, the ShowBuildingUI(true) call worked properly.

### Next Steps
- make the button to make a unit functional
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [4/04/2025], 13:53 - 14:05
### What I Worked On
- make the button to make a unit functional

### Challenges
- Instantiate spawned the unit inside the building

### Solutions
- added an offset to the instantiate

### Next Steps
- add a money system for testing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [6/04/2025], 19:51 - 20:16
### What I Worked On
- adding more buildings and units added a money system yesterday but forgot to add it to the dev log

### Challenges
- differentiating building types

### Solutions
- added a way to add units and ui to the script without changing the script

### Next Steps
- not sure yet
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [7/04/2025], 9:26 - 11:49

### What I Worked On
- Made building selection ignore clicks on UI
- Fixed UI panels deselecting buildings when clicked
- Made the 'Make Unit' button functional
- Added ability to place buildings only when enough money is available
- Allowed canceling building placement with right click
- Made selection UI close when a new building is being placed
-Created a flexible UI system that supports multiple building types (e.g., Barracks, War Factory)
- Added cooldown and build time system to unit spawning
- Fixed error: The referenced script on this Behaviour (Game Object '') is missing
### Challenges
- UI deselecting buildings when interacting with it
- Preventing building placement when not enough money is available
- Keeping track of canceled building placement and refunding cost
- Supporting scalable UI for multiple building types
- Preventing script errors when instantiating buildings with missing components
### Solutions
- Used EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject() to detect UI interaction
- Took money before allowing building placement and refunded it on cancel
- Deselected all current buildings when placing a new one to prevent UI from staying open unnecessarily
- Created BuildingUIEntry system with tag-to-panel mapping for scalable UI support
- Verified prefab references and made sure they're not null before instantiation
### Next Steps
- Add progress bars and visual indicators for unit build time
- Add individual cooldown timers for each building
- Show feedback when trying to build without enough money
- Implement queuing system for units
- Add audio/visual feedback on building placement and unit creation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## [7/04/2025], 11:56 - 12:38

### What I Worked On
- Implemented progress bars for unit and tank building processes in the UI.
- Added sliders to the UI panels for each building type, allowing for a visual progress display during the construction of units and tanks.
- Updated the BuildingSelections script to check and update the progress bars within the building UI panels as units and tanks are built.
- Ensured the sliders are shown when a building is selected and hidden once the construction is complete.
- Updated unit and tank spawning system to display both build time and cooldown time on a single slider in the UI.
- The slider first fills up during the build time (unit/tank being built), 
  then resets and fills up again to represent the cooldown time after the unit is spawned, preventing further use until the cooldown is complete.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a NullReferenceException that occurred due to incorrect UI component references when building units/tanks. 
  The issue was resolved by ensuring that the correct UI elements (sliders) are targeted and shown properly.
