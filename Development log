### What I Worked On
- Implemented RTS camera movement using arrow keys with Enhanced Input.

### Challenges
- Couldnâ€™t find Scale option in Enhanced Input.

### Solution
- Used 'Negate (Float)' modifier to make A = -1 and B = 1 for both.

### Next Steps
- Implement zoom, pan, and edge scrolling for the RTS camera.
