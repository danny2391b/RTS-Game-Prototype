### What I Worked On
- Implemented RTS camera movement using arrow keys with Enhanced Input.

### Challenges
- Couldn’t find Scale option in Enhanced Input.

### Solution
- Used 'Negate (Float)' modifier to make A = -1 and B = 1 for both.

### Next Steps
- Implement zoom, pan, and edge scrolling for the RTS camera.

### What I Worked On
- Fixed the right edge scrolling issue for the RTS camera.

### Challenges
- The camera was not moving when the mouse reached the right edge of the screen.

### Solution
- The issue was with the logic checking the mouse position.

- Originally, the condition was checking if Mouse X ≥ Edge Margin, which was incorrect.

- The correct condition is Mouse X ≥ (Viewport Width - EdgeMargin) to properly trigger right edge scrolling.

### Next Steps
- Implement zoom, pan for the RTS camera
