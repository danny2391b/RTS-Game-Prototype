Open the Character Blueprint:

Navigate to your Character Blueprint (e.g., BP_PlayerCharacter).

Open the Event Graph tab.

Add Input Axis Events:

In Project Settings > Input, add the following Axis Mappings:

MoveCameraX → Arrow Left (-1) and Arrow Right (+1)

MoveCameraY → Arrow Up (+1) and Arrow Down (-1)

Back in the Event Graph, search for MoveCameraX and MoveCameraY and add Axis Events for both.

Move Camera with Keyboard Input:

Drag off from the MoveCameraX event and add an Add Controller Yaw Input node.

Connect the Axis Value to the Add Controller Yaw Input node.

Drag off from the MoveCameraY event and add an Add Controller Pitch Input node.

Connect the Axis Value to the Add Controller Pitch Input node.

Implement Mouse Edge Scrolling:

Add an Event Tick node.

Drag off from it and add a Get Player Controller node.

From Get Player Controller, drag out and add a Get Mouse Position node.

Drag out from Get Mouse Position and store MouseX and MouseY as float variables.

Get Viewport Size by adding a Get Viewport Size node.

Compare MouseX and MouseY with the screen edges:

If MouseX <= 10, add -1 to Add Controller Yaw Input.

If MouseX >= Viewport Width - 10, add +1 to Add Controller Yaw Input.

If MouseY <= 10, add +1 to Add Controller Pitch Input.

If MouseY >= Viewport Height - 10, add -1 to Add Controller Pitch Input.
